# binrevolt
Silly RAT built more for looks than anything else. Probably never useful for anyone but me.
The purpose of this tool is for me to run some simple scripts and programs on the computers in my classroom and be able to monitor the usage without using tools that are too slow, complex, and otherwise unsuitable for the task. I also want the tool to have a needlessly gawdy graphical interface similar to old warez/cracking tools. This is also an opportunity for me to learn more about programming and github.
